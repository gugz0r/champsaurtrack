# champsaurtrack

My first Flutter project, for fun and profit.

## Getting Started

Launch the app !
Run.
Enjoy.

## Setup on FreeBSD

Install a MQTT server (rabbitmq) : 

pkg install rabbitmq

First-time users will want to run:

rabbitmq-plugins enable rabbitmq_management

and restart, to enable the web admin console at http://localhost:15672/
with a default username and password of guest:guest. You should change it.
